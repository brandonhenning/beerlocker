## What This Is
I loved working through the original Beerlocker Node.js tutorial by Scott K Smith. The link to the project is [here](http://scottksmith.com/blog/2014/05/02/building-restful-apis-with-node/). The project is a great way to get started with Node and some more advanced concepts but the code is about four years old. I decided to update the original project codecase with Javascript's more recent ES6 syntax. Let me know if you find any errors as I'm sure there are plenty! Thanks
